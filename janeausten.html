                <strong>Miss Elizabeth Bennet</strong>
                <br>
                Age: 20
                <br>
                Home: Hertfordshire
                <br><br>
                My greatest asset:
                <br>
                I believe my greatest asset is my wit, and the good-nature that I have learnt from being in a family of five young ladies!
                I am the greatest enjoyer of friendly banter, and I am unafraid to share my thoughts if I think them prevalent.
                <br><br>
                A quality I greatly admire:
                <br>
                I greatly admire someone who voices what he believes in and does not shy away from giving their opinion.
                However, I certainly will not stand by if these opinions offend; I believe a marriage must be equal, 
                and each party should look up to the other as their superior.
                <br><br>
                One thing I hope to do together in the future:
                <br>
                I am a great reader; there is truly no enjoyment like it. I find afternoons employed in such a pursuit quite diverting, 
                and I would happily spend a long walk discussing each of our novels.

                <strong>Mr. Bingley</strong>
                <br>
                Age: 22
                <br>
                Home: Hertfordshire
                <br><br>
                My favourite pastime: 
                <br>
                I adore making acquaintances and attending balls. There is nothing more diverting than forming friendships and entering 
                new circles. I also quite enjoy hunting and shooting, and spending time out of doors. 
                <br><br>
                One thing for which I am grateful:
                <br>
                I am quite grateful to have two very dear sisters, with whom I pass much time. They offer their advice remarkably freely, 
                and though I do not always follow it, I appreciate their efforts to lead me in the best direction. 
                <br><br>
                A quality I greatly admire:
                <br>
                I adore conversation, and I will get along swell with anyone with nearly so lively a disposition as I possess. My ideas 
                often flow faster than I can write or speak them, so I greatly admire anyone who has the patience to listen to my ramblings.

                <strong>Miss Harriet Smith</strong>
                <br>
                Home: Highbury
                <br>
                <br>
                One thing for which I am grateful:
                <br>
                I am so very grateful to have made the acquaintance of a most lovely friend, Miss Woodhouse, whose very matchmaking service 
                I am now using! I greatly admire Miss Woodhouse and thank her very kindly for all the grace she has shown me. 
                <br><br>
                My favourite pastime: 
                <br>
                I quite enjoy calling on my good friends in Highbury and conversing with them. I also adore collecting riddles and trying to solve them, although they often stump me! 
                <br><br>
                One thing I hope to do together in the future:
                <br>
                I am quite fond of taking walks, and I should greatly enjoy doing so together! I recently had quite the scare when I encountered a group of gypsies in the woods, so 
                I should quite like some sturdier company the next time I venture out.
