                <br>
                Home: Hertfordshire
                <br><br>
                <strong>My greatest asset:</strong>
                <br>
                I believe my greatest asset is my wit, and the good-nature that I have learnt from being in a family of five young ladies!
                I am the greatest enjoyer of friendly banter, and I am unafraid to share my thoughts if I think them prevalent.
                <br><br>
                <strong>A quality I greatly admire:</strong>
                <br>
                I greatly admire someone who voices what he believes in and does not shy away from giving their opinion.
                However, I certainly will not stand by if these opinions offend; I believe a marriage must be equal, 
                and each party should look up to the other as their superior.
                <br><br>
                <strong>One thing I hope to do together in the future:</strong>
                <br>
                I am a great reader; there is truly no enjoyment like it. I find afternoons employed in such a pursuit quite diverting, 
                and I would happily spend a long walk discussing each of our novels.

                Home: Hertfordshire

                <strong>My favourite pastime:</strong>
                <br>
                I adore making acquaintances and attending balls. There is nothing more diverting than forming friendships and entering 
                new circles. I also quite enjoy hunting and shooting, and spending time out of doors. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>One thing for which I am grateful:</strong>
                <br>
                I am quite grateful to have two very dear sisters, with whom I pass much time. They offer their advice remarkably freely, 
                and though I do not always follow it, I appreciate their efforts to lead me in the best direction. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>A quality I greatly admire:</strong>
                <br>
                I adore conversation, and I will get along swell with anyone with nearly so lively a disposition as I possess. My ideas 
                often flow faster than I can write or speak them, so I greatly admire anyone who has the patience to listen to my ramblings.

                <strong>One thing for which I am grateful:</strong>
                <br>
                I am so very grateful to have made the acquaintance of a most lovely friend, Miss Woodhouse, whose very matchmaking service 
                I am now using! I greatly admire Miss Woodhouse and thank her very kindly for all the grace she has shown me. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>My favourite pastime:</strong>
                <br>
                I quite enjoy calling on my good friends in Highbury and conversing with them. I also adore collecting riddles and trying to solve them, although they often stump me! 
                <br><br>
                <strong>One thing I hope to do together in the future:</strong>
                <br>
                I am quite fond of taking walks, and I should greatly enjoy doing so together! I recently had quite the scare when I encountered a group of gypsies in the woods, so 
                I should quite like some sturdier company the next time I venture out.

                <br>
                Home: Kent
                <br><br>
                <strong>My favourite pastime:</strong>
                <br>
                I am chiefly fond of reading scriptures, as well as a variety of sermons. Fordyce’s Sermons, particularly, ought to be read by every young lady as a guide on how to 
                conduct themselves. It is my understanding that many young ladies would greatly benefit from such an experience, a view which is shared by my infinitely generous patroness Lady Catherine DeBourgh. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>One thing for which I am grateful:</strong>
                <br>
                I am eternally indebted to Lady Caterine DeBourgh for her exceptional kindness towards me. Just this week she has invited me to dine with her at Rosings, her expansive 
                estate, and has even paid me the kindness of calling on me personally during the day. It is a wonder that her visits increase so significantly in the winter, a time which would usually prevent 
                such travels and conversations, but Lady Catherine’s nature is such that she would grant a visit from her humble cleric when no one else should be prepared to travel. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>My greatest asset:</strong>
                <br>
                I must profess that my greatest asset is my connection with the family of DeBourgh. Such a renowned and generous house as theirs holds true status and influence, which I am privy to as a recipient of their benevolence.

                Age: 22
                <br>
                Home: Hertfordshire
                <br><br>
                <strong>My most important value:</strong>
                <br>
                I truly believe that everybody must have good intentions, and I always try to give them a chance to show their own goodness. I always try to take the good out of everybody’s character and make it still better, 
                and say nothing of the bad. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>A quality I greatly admire:</strong>
                <br>
                I strongly admire anybody who is lively, with a cheerful demeanor. However, I truly am disposed to like most anybody, and there is something that agrees with me in every person I encounter. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>My favourite pastime:</strong>
                <br>
                Though I am regrettably not a proficient musician, I am quite fond of embroidering and sewing. I take great pleasure in retrimming my sisters’ bonnets and dresses. I just recently completed a 
                ribbon top for one of my sister Kitty’s boxes, which I greatly enjoyed.

                <strong>My favourite pastime:</strong>
                <br>
                I am chiefly fond of dancing, perhaps overly so. I find it to be incredibly diverting, and there is nothing more felicitous than the rapid motion of a large group. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>A quality I greatly admire:</strong>
                <br>
                Much like dancing, I adore music. The playing of the pianoforte enchants me, especially when I am privileged to hear a song I have once danced to, and am able to recall such fond memories.

                <strong>One thing I hope to do together in the future:</strong>
                <br>
                I am quite compelled to travel abroad. I am sick of England, and would leave it tomorrow if I could. I wish to visit the continent, where the climate might be warmer, and I am quite desirous of a partner in my travels.

                I absolutely adore shopping in Meryton and buying ribbons, and I should love to do so together! It is such a joy to travel into town and see all the excitement, and meet the army men, and visit all the shops!

                <br>
                My Mamma tells me I have the second-most lovely features of all my sisters, and even though my Pappa says I am a foolish girl, I know I am simply the liveliest of us all! That is why my Mamma has brought me into public at only sixteen, because she knows I am so good-humoured.

                <br>
                I adore our militia officers, and their shiny red coats. I find it so brave and admirable that they are so eager to protect us, and it is always so exciting when they come to stay in Meryton.

                <strong>A quality I greatly admire:</strong>
                <br>
                A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, all the modern languages, to be called accomplished, and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address, and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.
                <br><br>
                <strong>One thing I am not fond of:</strong>
                <br>
                I am not particularly fond of balls and dancing, especially with a partner with whom I am not well acquainted. I would much prefer a more private setting in which it is easier to understand one another.
                <br><br>
                <strong>My most important value:</strong>
                <br>
                I firmly believe that one’s outward conduct should represent them truthfully. Nothing is more deceitful than the appearance of humility, and though I can forgive a lack of modesty, deceit will grant the permanent loss of my good opinion.

                Age: 21
                <br>
                Home: London
                <br><br>
                <strong>My favourite pastime:</strong>
                <br>
                I adore playing the piano, and I have passed many a joyful hour with it. I recently received a lovely set of Irish melodies, and I have particularly enjoyed playing “Robin Adair,” which I have learnt most recently. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>One thing I am not fond of:</strong>
                <br>
                Oh my, how could I ever answer this question? There are so few things I am not fond of. You should really never hear me speak ill of any thing. I am quite happy with my lot in life, though I may soon be in new circumstances, as I have fallen victim to the governess-trade. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>An uncommon opinion I hold:</strong>
                <br>
                I am excessively fond of walking, even when the weather does not agree with my desires! I would much prefer a walk into town to taking a carriage, and I often take walks to clear my head and appreciate my whereabouts.

                <br><br>
                <strong>One thing I am not fond of:</strong>
                <br>
                I find an excess of pride to be most odious, especially when possessed by those who do not merit it. It is a vicious trait, and it taints everything, even good deeds that may seem well-intended. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>My greatest asset:</strong>
                <br>
                I am in possession of a most lively disposition, and I find it easy to make new acquaintances everywhere I travel with the militia. I believe my manners to be quite appealing, and I do my best to charm and befriend everyone I meet. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>One thing I hope to do together in the future:</strong>
                <br>
                I should love to travel to the north of England together, or even to Scotland. I adore the scenery there, from what I have seen on my travels with the army, and I should greatly appreciate a travelling partner when I next return.
